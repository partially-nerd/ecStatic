# ecStatic
Yet another framework for web design. Does it really need documentation? It's just that simple

# Documentation
## Installing dependencies
`npm i`

## Running the server
`npm run watch`

*Note: Please do not run without the read, and write flags. It's for the server's safety. The 'watch' script already uses all the flags, so there's nothing to worry about*
*Note: The default port is 3000*
